## What to Do Next

1. **Look at all 4 mockups** in the Finder window that just opened
2. **Pick your favorite(s)** - or tell me if you want changes
3. **Choose refinement path**:
   - Use as-is (I can integrate into app immediately)
   - Polish in Figma/Inkscape (you do this)
   - Generate AI variations (I can create prompts or you use existing ones)
   - Try different concepts (Chechia, Harissa label, etc.)
