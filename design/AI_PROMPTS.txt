GENERATION TIPS
================================================================================

For DALL-E:
- Use these prompts as-is
- Generate 2-4 variations by clicking "Generate again"
- Save all outputs even if not perfect
- Can iterate with "Make the chili more curved" etc.

For Midjourney:
- Add "--ar 1:1" at the end for square
- Add "--style raw" for more literal interpretation
- Try "--stylize 250" for cleaner icons
- Use "/imagine" command before prompt

For Stable Diffusion:
- Add "vector art, flat design, icon" to beginning
- Use negative prompt: "3d, realistic, photo, blur, noise"
- Use PNG output for transparency
