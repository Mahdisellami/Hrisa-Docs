## Saving Your Results

### Where to Save
Save all downloaded images to:
```
/Users/peng/Documents/mse/private/Document-Processing/design/concepts/ai_generated/
```

I created this folder for you!

### Naming Convention
Name your downloads clearly so we can discuss them:
```
bing_diagonal_chili_v1.png
bing_diagonal_chili_v2.png

```

Or just keep Bing's default names - we'll rename later.

## Troubleshooting

### "Content Warning" or Blocked
- Bing sometimes flags harmless prompts
- Try removing color codes: delete "#C62828" etc.
- Or simplify: "red chili pepper on white document"

### Results Too Realistic/Photo-Like
- Add to prompt: "flat design vector illustration icon style"
- Or: "not photorealistic, graphic design icon"

### Results Have Wrong Colors
- Be more specific: "bright red #C62828, pure white background"
- Or: "Tunisian harissa red color and white paper"

### Text is Garbled (if using text prompts)
- DALL-E sometimes struggles with text
- Generate without text first
- We can add "Hrisa Docs" text later in Figma/vector software
